#Script Execution
The script will organize files in the specified $main_directory/file_structure directory. It will create sub-directories for each category (images, documents, videos, scripts, and audios) and move the respective files into these sub-directories based on their file extensions.

Please note that the script will not delete any files but only organize them. Any sub-directories that become empty after the organization will be removed.

Important Note
Please use this script responsibly and always keep a backup of your important files before running any file organization scripts.
